      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <p>Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>The first thing that worked is that we were able to gain followers, a total of 32, as of today, the 12th of April. We believe that we were able to achieve this because we built brand awareness by posting 3 times a week, every second day. Therefore, we presented a new product in the market, which automatically attracted customers. Furthermore, we were also able to present a colour coordinated and aesthetically pleasing Instagram page. This can be conveyed through the organisation on our page, as we made a conscious decision of making alternating rows of black and white monochromatic, and coloured posts. Lastly, our group also achieved to establish a fully functioning social media platform without any technical difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Opposingly, one factor that didn’t work out as we hoped it would, was being able to maintain a regular posting schedule. Three out of the eight posting days were not kept because we forgot to. This meant that we posted the following day. Hence, what we would do differently in the future is stick to our Instagram posting days, by setting a reminder on our phones to post. The reason why this is something we would improve in the future is because it could confuse our followers, who have caught onto our posting schedule. Additionally, it could even disappoint and frustrate specific followers, as they expect to see a post, yet we do not maintain a regular posting schedule.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Alongside this, we were also not able to reach our goal of 40 followers (we ended up having 32, as of today, the 12th of April). We believe that one of the reasons for this was that we could have increased exposure to our Instagram page, and this is something we would definitely do differently and apply in the future. The way in which we would achieve a higher exposure towards our Instagram page, is by posting more Instagram stories, as this would capture the attention of individuals, and then lead them to our page. Subsequently, resulting in a higher followers total.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the fact that we were not able to reach our goal of 40 followers was one of the things that, surprisingly, went as expected. This is because we have concluded that there isn’t as much demand or attention given to Instagram pages created solely for a university project, as opposed to one's own personal page. We have gained this insight from past experience, having to create Instagram pages for our short movies. Moreover, the second thing that went as expected was that we gained at least 10 followers. This was an expectation because, once again, due to past experience with creating Instagram pages for university projects, you usually gain around 20 to 70 followers. Therefore, we knew that our followers' number would not remain below 10 for the entirety of the project.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the contrast, what did not go as expected it that the colour scheme on our Instagram page came across as strongly as it did. This was already mentioned in the section above, regarding what went well. However, this is still a factor that also qualifies as something that did not go as expected. We had the idea of alternating black and white monochrome and coloured rows, but we were uncertain as to whether or not we would be able to stick to it as well as we did. What could have happened was that we forgot about the organisation of our page, and posted a coloured post when it was time to post a monochromatic black and white post. In addition, we also did not expect our followers to be as unresponsive to our interactive story elements as they were. The interactive story elements include polls and questionaries. Unfortunately, when we posted a poll about what their favourite scent is, nobody answered. This, as well as no responsiveness when it came to our second poll about what their favoured scent is out of all the ones included in our fragrance. What we would do differently, in this case, would be to post more frequently on our Instagram story so that our page becomes more apparent on their phone and they notice our brand more. This would result in more trust towards our brand because the more content they get exposed to from our brand, the more trustworthy we become. Hence, this could potentially increase their willingness to then respond to our story polls.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What also did not go we expected is that it would be so difficult to portray our colour palette on our Instagram page. We were able to establish an especially pleasing and colour coordinated Instagram page, as mentioned earlier. However, the monochromatic and coloured rows got in the way of allowing our colour palette to come across as dominantly as we wanted to. Our colour palette consisted of 6 colours, yet we only conveyed four out of the six. One must admit that it is difficult to establish a consistent colour palette throughout posts when have of them are black and white.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Besides this, coming up with a good-enough name for our Instagram page also didn’t go as expected because it was harder than expected. What we considered a ‘good-enough’ name was one that was original, professional-sounding, and catchy. We then decided to end up with <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>. Whilst brainstorming names, our group encountered limitations from the Instagram app in applying uppercase letters, as well as how many words our name could constitute of. Due to this, our name transitioned from <em>bernard_and_bianca</em>, to <em>thesmelloflove</em>, to <em>welovebernardandbianca</em>, and to our final one,&nbsp; <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, reflecting back on the progress of our name, <em>thesmelloflove</em> was the most original and the catchiest name out of all, and thus, the one we should have stuck with. We changed it and left it at <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>, however, because we saw another group include the word ‘official’ in theirs, and we simply decided to include it in ours as well. We were slightly desperate to find a name that worked within Instagram’s algorithm of page names, whilst still maintaining the professional-sounding aspect to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, not receiving as many likes on our posts as we hoped for also didn’t go as expected. As of today, the 12th of April, the highest amount of likes we have received on a post has been 13. What we noticed is that when we advertised our posts on our story, it was those specific ones that received more likes. An example is when we posted our coloured post (including the oranges), and then decided to promote it on our story, it was this specific one that received the most likes out of the whole set of posts that were uploaded that week. Due to this, we can conclude that what we would do differently in the future is to make sure to make some sort of announcement on our stories about each one of our new posts.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Due to all these experiences and insights, some of the things we learned are that managing a social media page is harder than expected, you constantly have to stay on top of your content and make sure to inform your followers when you have uploaded a new post, you need to make sure to engage your followers with polls and relatable content, and that carrying through a well-established colour theme throughout your page is extremely important to make it look more professional. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Throughout the course of this project, the things we have achieved were creating a social media account (Instagram), gaining exposure to our new and uprising brand, accumulating followers, and spreading awareness about our vision statement and message. The way in which we gained exposure to our brand was through our Instagram page, and having a regular uploading system in place. We also made sure to share what we stand for (our message) in the bio of our Instagram page. By having our message come together alongside our social media page, we have established a successful promotion of our fragrance brand to a good amount of people.</p>
      <p>Apart from the positives that we mentioned having achieved, there are still certain things we would do differently if the project continued. We would include more calls to action on our social media platform, and in regards to social media platforms, we would also increase how many we use. This is because we decided to only go with one, namely, Instagram, and this made it harder to reach a larger target audience. In regards to including more calls to action, we did not include any on our Instagram, yet had we, we believe that we would have more loyal customers. The reasoning behind this is that, through calls of action, a brand interacts more with its followers, and thus, they established closer and more trustworthy bonds with their clients. In return, their work towards creating more loyal customers which, from that moment on, created a personal connection and tie with the brand.</p>
	 <p>If the campaign continued, one of our future recommendations would be to increase the exposure of our brand on more than one social media platform. This is because we only posted on Instagram, and this resulted in us completely relying on just one platform to be able to present our brand and gain loyal customers and enough interest. This is a rather risky thing to do, because when you only focus on one platform, and you don’t find it going well because you are not successful enough at reaching the desired people, then you are still stuck with solely that platform. Therefore, we would focus on maintaining more than one social media platform to promote our brand! It will also increase the exposure of the brand; as simple as that. Nevertheless, we were making sure that we are only using the social media platforms that are applicable to our target audience, in order to be as effective as possible with our promotion! Another future recommendation we have would be to go the extra step and use paid advertising to publicise our brand. This could be achieved through means such as filming a promotion to then upload it to youtube, doing affiliate marketing, and even using social media influencers to build your brand image and awareness. The advantage all these have in common is that it immediately makes one’s brand more official and trustworthy, as there is money being invested in your brand to promote it (in return for something, of course!).</p>
	<p>What we would do differently based on our experience, is to post more actively on our chosen social media platform, Instagram. This is not because we rarely posted, (as we did post three times a week), but because we only uploaded our first post on the 28th of March. This meant that we started promoting our brand on social media too late, and therefore, we only ended up with nine posts, and a three week social media presence. We believe that this did not suffice, and we would have been able to gain more followers and attain more exposure towards our fragrance brand if we had more posts. This is because the more we post, the more our brand would have been prominent on people’s phones, as they would constantly see our page on their story bar. Thus, based on our experience, something we would do different would definitely be to start posting earlier.</p>
