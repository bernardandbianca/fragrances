      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Our social media campaign is focused on raising awareness of our brand and establishing loyal customers, between the ages of 18 to 35. Our message is to give every relationship the last push towards establishing a meaningful and uplifting bond. Therefore, we concluded that 18 to 35 years olds are young adults who are at the stage of forming meaningful relationships, and thus, are the perfect target audience for our brand. However, our initial age range was 20 to 35 year olds because they are young adults who are at the stage of starting their studies and even work, and transitioning into wanting to start a family. Nevertheless, the reason why we changed our age range to 18 to 35 year olds is because we looked into the students within our study and a lot of them were 18. Due to this, we extended the minimum age to 18 years.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With our Instagram page we were able to gain 31 followers, upload nine posts, have a total of five stories, and include two reels on our social media account. As of the latest insights, ranging from April 5th to April 11th, we succeeded in reaching 19 accounts, engaging 5 accounts, and having a total of 32 followers. However, as mentioned above, we ended up with 31 followers, meaning that one individual unfollowed us. A reason for this could be that our content was not customer-oriented enough, but rather, more product focused. What this looked like in terms of our posts, were posts that were mainly product specific, such as our bottle design and the smells it contains. Instead, we should have included more quotes that also speak to our followers.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In order convey our message, as well as the following objectives, we created an Instagram account (bernardandbianca.official), as well as a website where potential customers can get information about the brand, the product, and eventually, purchase it. Initially, however, we aimed towards maintaining three social media brands, namely Facebook, Tiktok, and Instagram. However, we reduced this to only Instagram because in the solution interviews, the majority of our participants stated that their most used platform was Instagram. Alongside this, TikTok was not suitable for the maturity of our target audience, and we also believed that perfume being such a high end product should not be promoted on as informal of a social media platform as TikTok.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the following we will not only go into more detail about the objectives we set as a brand, but how we executed them on the chosen platforms.</p>
      <p>In regards to the different objectives which we will mention, there are affect objectives, reach objectives, and response objectives. Affect objectives have to do with what you want your target audience to feel? Reach objectives signify the number of people who are likely to see your message on what platform. Lastly, reponse objectives focus on what you want the target audience to do.</p>
      <p>Our affect objectives are the following: we would like our audience to feel empowered, confident, sexy, lustful, and fullfilled. We chose empowered because we believe that perfume enables any individual to feel better in their own skin and feel empowered to achieve anything. This is because the better you smell, the more it indicates that one takes care of themselves and their well-being. Therefore, this lifts them up and enables them to feel more empowered. Furthermore, Bernard&amp;Bianca fragrances allow our audience to feel sexy because smelling good makes anyone feel good about themselves, and you naturally radiate confidence which attracts people. This attraction between people could lead to a meaningful relationship and finding true love. Also, our brand’s slogan is The smell of love, and this originated from naturally attracting other people by how one smells. This was also made clear to us during our problem interviews, as several participants stated that smelling good is a very important key factor when it comes to attractiveness. Hence, wanting our target audience to also feel lustful ties into the previous point, about how smelling good makes you more attractive. If you are single, feel confident in yourself and smell good, this will create a feeling of lust in certain individuals around you. Lastly, as a brand we want out clients to feel fulfilled, because we strive to give every relationship the last push towards establishing a meaningful and uplifting bond.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Our goal that we set out to achieve throughout the project was to reach 40 people on Instagram in the first month of posting on social media (28th of March until the 28th of April). This goal is measurable as we can simply assess it by the number of followers we have.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we also set out to achieve our response objectives. In our case, we wanted them to get to know our brand, believe in our brand’s vision statement and the problem we identified, feel confident in themselves and their surroundings in order to build up the courage to love, feel sexy and beautiful, and establish trustworthy and meaningful relationships.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To have achieved our objectives, we belive we could have done a better job. This is because we mainly focused on portraying our fragrance, and its design and smell, rather than establishing a bond with our customers. The way we would have achieved this bond would have been to post more interactive content, such as polls and questionaires, which would allow our customers to feel more involved with our brand. As a consequence, allowing them to create a stronger bond and relation with our brand. Additionally, we would also post more content that encourages feelings of acceptance and self-happiness. An example of such a post would be a daily reminder about how focusing on yourself rather than trying to win over other people, will make you a stronger and better person. Small reminders like this will help create a concrete impression that our brand is one that makes you feel empowered and confident. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>The first thing that worked is that we were able to gain followers, a total of 32, as of today, the 12th of April. We believe that we were able to achieve this because we built brand awareness by posting 3 times a week, every second day. Therefore, we presented a new product in the market, which automatically attracted customers. Furthermore, we were also able to present a colour coordinated and aesthetically pleasing Instagram page. This can be conveyed through the organisation on our page, as we made a conscious decision of making alternating rows of black and white monochromatic, and coloured posts. Lastly, our group also achieved to establish a fully functioning social media platform without any technical difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Opposingly, one factor that didn’t work out as we hoped it would, was being able to maintain a regular posting schedule. Three out of the eight posting days were not kept because we forgot to. This meant that we posted the following day. Hence, what we would do differently in the future is stick to our Instagram posting days, by setting a reminder on our phones to post. The reason why this is something we would improve in the future is because it could confuse our followers, who have caught onto our posting schedule. Additionally, it could even disappoint and frustrate specific followers, as they expect to see a post, yet we do not maintain a regular posting schedule.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Alongside this, we were also not able to reach our goal of 40 followers (we ended up having 32, as of today, the 12th of April). We believe that one of the reasons for this was that we could have increased exposure to our Instagram page, and this is something we would definitely do differently and apply in the future. The way in which we would achieve a higher exposure towards our Instagram page, is by posting more Instagram stories, as this would capture the attention of individuals, and then lead them to our page. Subsequently, resulting in a higher followers total.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the fact that we were not able to reach our goal of 40 followers was one of the things that, surprisingly, went as expected. This is because we have concluded that there isn’t as much demand or attention given to Instagram pages created solely for a university project, as opposed to one's own personal page. We have gained this insight from past experience, having to create Instagram pages for our short movies. Moreover, the second thing that went as expected was that we gained at least 10 followers. This was an expectation because, once again, due to past experience with creating Instagram pages for university projects, you usually gain around 20 to 70 followers. Therefore, we knew that our followers' number would not remain below 10 for the entirety of the project.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the contrast, what did not go as expected it that the colour scheme on our Instagram page came across as strongly as it did. This was already mentioned in the section above, regarding what went well. However, this is still a factor that also qualifies as something that did not go as expected. We had the idea of alternating black and white monochrome and coloured rows, but we were uncertain as to whether or not we would be able to stick to it as well as we did. What could have happened was that we forgot about the organisation of our page, and posted a coloured post when it was time to post a monochromatic black and white post. In addition, we also did not expect our followers to be as unresponsive to our interactive story elements as they were. The interactive story elements include polls and questionaries. Unfortunately, when we posted a poll about what their favourite scent is, nobody answered. This, as well as no responsiveness when it came to our second poll about what their favoured scent is out of all the ones included in our fragrance. What we would do differently, in this case, would be to post more frequently on our Instagram story so that our page becomes more apparent on their phone and they notice our brand more. This would result in more trust towards our brand because the more content they get exposed to from our brand, the more trustworthy we become. Hence, this could potentially increase their willingness to then respond to our story polls.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What also did not go we expected is that it would be so difficult to portray our colour palette on our Instagram page. We were able to establish an especially pleasing and colour coordinated Instagram page, as mentioned earlier. However, the monochromatic and coloured rows got in the way of allowing our colour palette to come across as dominantly as we wanted to. Our colour palette consisted of 6 colours, yet we only conveyed four out of the six. One must admit that it is difficult to establish a consistent colour palette throughout posts when have of them are black and white.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Besides this, coming up with a good-enough name for our Instagram page also didn’t go as expected because it was harder than expected. What we considered a ‘good-enough’ name was one that was original, professional-sounding, and catchy. We then decided to end up with <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>. Whilst brainstorming names, our group encountered limitations from the Instagram app in applying uppercase letters, as well as how many words our name could constitute of. Due to this, our name transitioned from <em>bernard_and_bianca</em>, to <em>thesmelloflove</em>, to <em>welovebernardandbianca</em>, and to our final one,&nbsp; <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, reflecting back on the progress of our name, <em>thesmelloflove</em> was the most original and the catchiest name out of all, and thus, the one we should have stuck with. We changed it and left it at <em>bernardandbianca.official</em>, however, because we saw another group include the word ‘official’ in theirs, and we simply decided to include it in ours as well. We were slightly desperate to find a name that worked within Instagram’s algorithm of page names, whilst still maintaining the professional-sounding aspect to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, not receiving as many likes on our posts as we hoped for also didn’t go as expected. As of today, the 12th of April, the highest amount of likes we have received on a post has been 13. What we noticed is that when we advertised our posts on our story, it was those specific ones that received more likes. An example is when we posted our coloured post (including the oranges), and then decided to promote it on our story, it was this specific one that received the most likes out of the whole set of posts that were uploaded that week. Due to this, we can conclude that what we would do differently in the future is to make sure to make some sort of announcement on our stories about each one of our new posts.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Due to all these experiences and insights, some of the things we learned are that managing a social media page is harder than expected, you constantly have to stay on top of your content and make sure to inform your followers when you have uploaded a new post, you need to make sure to engage your followers with polls and relatable content, and that carrying through a well-established colour theme throughout your page is extremely important to make it look more professional. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Throughout the course of this project, the things we have achieved were creating a social media account (Instagram), gaining exposure to our new and uprising brand, accumulating followers, and spreading awareness about our vision statement and message. The way in which we gained exposure to our brand was through our Instagram page, and having a regular uploading system in place. We also made sure to share what we stand for (our message) in the bio of our Instagram page. By having our message come together alongside our social media page, we have established a successful promotion of our fragrance brand to a good amount of people.</p>
      <p>Apart from the positives that we mentioned having achieved, there are still certain things we would do differently if the project continued. We would include more calls to action on our social media platform, and in regards to social media platforms, we would also increase how many we use. This is because we decided to only go with one, namely, Instagram, and this made it harder to reach a larger target audience. In regards to including more calls to action, we did not include any on our Instagram, yet had we, we believe that we would have more loyal customers. The reasoning behind this is that, through calls of action, a brand interacts more with its followers, and thus, they established closer and more trustworthy bonds with their clients. In return, their work towards creating more loyal customers which, from that moment on, created a personal connection and tie with the brand.</p>
	 <p>If the campaign continued, one of our future recommendations would be to increase the exposure of our brand on more than one social media platform. This is because we only posted on Instagram, and this resulted in us completely relying on just one platform to be able to present our brand and gain loyal customers and enough interest. This is a rather risky thing to do, because when you only focus on one platform, and you don’t find it going well because you are not successful enough at reaching the desired people, then you are still stuck with solely that platform. Therefore, we would focus on maintaining more than one social media platform to promote our brand! It will also increase the exposure of the brand; as simple as that. Nevertheless, we were making sure that we are only using the social media platforms that are applicable to our target audience, in order to be as effective as possible with our promotion! Another future recommendation we have would be to go the extra step and use paid advertising to publicise our brand. This could be achieved through means such as filming a promotion to then upload it to youtube, doing affiliate marketing, and even using social media influencers to build your brand image and awareness. The advantage all these have in common is that it immediately makes one’s brand more official and trustworthy, as there is money being invested in your brand to promote it (in return for something, of course!).</p>
	<p>What we would do differently based on our experience, is to post more actively on our chosen social media platform, Instagram. This is not because we rarely posted, (as we did post three times a week), but because we only uploaded our first post on the 28th of March. This meant that we started promoting our brand on social media too late, and therefore, we only ended up with nine posts, and a three week social media presence. We believe that this did not suffice, and we would have been able to gain more followers and attain more exposure towards our fragrance brand if we had more posts. This is because the more we post, the more our brand would have been prominent on people’s phones, as they would constantly see our page on their story bar. Thus, based on our experience, something we would do different would definitely be to start posting earlier.</p>
